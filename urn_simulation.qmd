Sometimes, even the smallest objects can reveal big patterns when we look closely at their traits. Using data from a simulated urn containing 1,000 beads of different colors and sizes, we explore whether a beadâ€™s size can help predict its color.
Our model may be limited by the assumption that the sample is perfectly random and representative, which may not hold if the beads were not thoroughly mixed before sampling
